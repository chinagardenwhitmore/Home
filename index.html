			<h3>Hi, I'm Dante </h3>
		</div>
		<p>As you read this, I'm probably delving into something new I know nothing about. Whether it be in school or in personal projects, I love learning. A bit about myself: I'm in my third year studying computer science at Grand Valley State University, and if you look closely at the banner photo, you'll catch our logo. I love solving complex problems, and it turns out computers are a great way to do just that. I want to be a part of problem solving for the indefinite future, so I'm learning the language(s) of computers. Currently, I'm back in the classroom and have recently decided to take the steps necessary to move beyond a hobbyist level of knowledge with machine leaning and study it academically.</p>

		<h3>Bias Bot</h3>
		<p>
		My friends and I were curious to see if we could somehow quantify a prevalent problem today, bias in news. Using machine learning, my team and I were able to (mostly) do exactly that. After Bias Bot predicts how an article spins the topic, it provides the user with a few articles to round their viewpoint out. While Bias Bot is still very much a work in progress, it gave the team a great introduction to building something cool with machine learning.

		<h3>Pomodoro Timer</h3>
		<p>
		There's a pretty good chance you've heard of the Pomodoro technique, and that's because it works. The problem I faced when using the Pomodoro technique was finding background music and setting a timer took too much time away from productivity. The Pomodoro Timer asks the user how long they want to be productive for, break duration, and a music genre. From there, it does the heavy lifting and lets the user focus on productivity.

		<h3>2048</h3>
		<p>
		2048 is the only project from my coursework included on my site, but I feel as if I had to because I may have had a bit too much fun with it. The original 2048 consumed my entire high school when it was hot, so I felt that if I was going to clone it, I had to do it justice. On top of the base requirements, I included a leaderboard, color changing tiles and sliding tiles. This is written in Java and I opted to use JavaFX instead of Swing for the front end.
